\chapter*{Abstract}

Friedgut, Kalai, and Nisan have proved that social choice functions can be successfully manipulated by random preference reordering with non-negligible probability \cite{friedgut2008elections}. However, their results require two restrictions: the social choice function must be neutral, and the election must have at most 3 alternatives. In this thesis we focus on removing the later restriction and generalizing the results to elections with any number of candidates. We also provide a survey of related work analyzing and comparing results from a number of authors.
