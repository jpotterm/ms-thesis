\chapter*{Abstract}

We study manipulation in election systems, looking specifically at random manipulation. This work is based on work by Friedgut, Kalai, and Nisan \cite{friedgut2008elections} and by Xia and Conitzer \cite{xia2008sufficient}, and we analyze these papers and attempt to improve upon their results. These authors condition their results on voting rules having certain properties, and we intend to look at what happens when these conditions are replaced by stronger or weaker conditions. Friedgut, Kalai, and Nisan's results hold only for elections with three candidates, and we would like to extend the results to any number of candidates. Xia and Conitzer's results hold only for election systems that satisfy their five properties and this excludes some common election systems. We would like to relax these conditions to capture more common election systems while still achieving the same results. We would like to tighten the bounds given by these two papers by a constant factor or by making them depend on the number of candidates.
