\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Christopher Homan, without whom this work and my academic endeavors would have been greatly diminished. Thank you for many hours of instruction and encouragement, and for challenging me to better myself. You have made this an enjoyable experience and I have learned and grown by leaps and bounds, both academically and otherwise.

Second, I would like to thank my family---which I am so lucky to be a part of---whose love and support undergird all of my endeavors.
