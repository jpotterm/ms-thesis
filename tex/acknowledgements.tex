\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Christopher Homan, without whom this work and my academic endeavors would have been greatly impoverished. Thank you for many, many hours of instruction, encouragement, and, sometimes, much needed spurring onward towards the goal. You have made this an enjoyable experience and I have learned and grown in ways I never imagined.

Second, I would like to thank my family, whose love and support undergird all of my endeavors. I am incredibly privileged.
